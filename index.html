The notes below supplement an ongoing project with a good friend, [Connor Sempek](https://github.com/connorsempek). Our main objective is to re-create simulations of Ising model dynamics from [this](http://bit-player.org/2021/three-months-in-monte-carlo) blog post by [Brian Hayes](http://bit-player.org/about-the-author). The underlying 'canvas' of the model is two-dimensional, and the simulation generates a sequence of two-color 100x100 pixel images. The two colors represent the two possible _spin_ values of the [Ising model](https://www.unige.ch/math/folks/velenik/smbook/Ising_Model.pdf), $+1$ and $-1$ (though the term spin is used, the model is not quantum-mechanical). The magnetic interpretation is of the model is that each pixel is some atomic site in a crystal lattice, and the color value of each pixel describes one of two opposing magnetic orientations the atom can posess. At a given temperature $T$, a sample from the Ising model (in our context) corresponds to a randomly generated image. The dynamics of the Ising model correspond to a movie formed by a sequence of these images. Each image is obtained from the previous in the sequence by randomly updating the spin $\equiv$ color at a randomly selected pixel, updating one pixel at a time. This movie is analogous to viewing a bar of iron under a microscope, when the updates are rapid enough. 

As discussed in the notes, images generated in our simulation project will be used as a computer vision dataset. Independently, I would like to supplement the notes with those I took in [Tuca](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/)'s course on spin glass theory.
