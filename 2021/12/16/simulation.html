<p>$\quad$ These notes serve as background for an ongoing project with a good friend, <a href="https://github.com/connorsempek">Connor Sempek</a>. We are following <a href="http://bit-player.org/2021/three-months-in-monte-carlo">this</a> blog post by <a href="http://bit-player.org/about-the-author">Brian Hayes</a>. Our current objective is to re-create Hayes' simulations of Ising model dynamics. The underlying canvas of the model is two-dimensional, so the simulation can be thought of as a way to generate a sequence of <code>100x100</code> pixel images, with pixel values either black or white. The Ising model dynamics update the current image by changing the value of one pixel at a time. The purpose of these notes is to get a better understanding of how long the simulation must be run so that, for a sparse enough subsequence of the images:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each is sampled approximately from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_measure">Gibbs probability measure</a> governing the Ising model, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>these are nearly independent.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>$\quad$ The latter property is important for a longer term goal of the project, which is to use these subsequences of images as a computer vision dataset. Importantly, the Gibbs measure we are sampling from always depends on a global temperature parameter $T$, leading to natural classification and regression tasks.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>$\quad$ Here is a starting point for formulating a classification task. Suppose that we can simulate Ising model dynamics well at two <em>distinct</em> temperatures. It feels natural to choose one of these, say $T_1$, above the critical temperature $T_c$ of the model, and the other, $T_2$ below it. We then create two image datasets $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ of equal size by simulating as described by the two points above. Merging these datasets to form what we call $\mathcal{D}$ leads to a natural classification problem: given an element $x \in \mathcal{D}$ chosen uniformly at random, determine whether it came from $\mathcal{D}_1$ or $\mathcal{D}_2$.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>$\quad$ The relevance of the Ising model to vision has been explored heavily, it seems. A lot of the text below draws from Govind Menon's <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/menon/publications/pt-2020.pdf">pattern theory</a> notes, where a chapter is devoted to this "energetic" perspective applied to character recognition tasks. Menon's notes also reference a 1984 <a href="http://www.peterbeerli.com/classes/images/a/a1/Geman_geman_1984.pdf">paper</a> which develops a way to perform image restoration and enhancement using the Ising model. This makes it a natural model to experiment with, and there are a few directions I'd like to explore longer term:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the lower temperature, $T_2$, simulating the model is akin to an optimization problem: as $T \to 0$, the Gibbs measure concentrates on the set of lowest-energy states, or <em>ground states</em>. Any simulation designed to sample from a low-temperature Gibbs measure needs to navigate the energy landscape of the system from some starting point to a low altitude, with the temperature dictating a small range of desirable low altitudes $\equiv$ low energies. This is effectively an optimization problem with cost function corresponding to the energy landscape. There is also an optimization inherent to the process of training any neural network on the classification task suggested. The question I would like to explore, loosely, is whether there are useful connections between these optimization problems. </li>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<ol>
<li>We will train a simple convolutional architecture on the dataset $\mathcal{D}$. Whether it is through pooling layers, or the local averaging inherent in the convolution operation, these architectures seem to apply a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarse-grained_modeling">coarse-graining</a> to input signals $x \in \mathcal{D}$. This has prompted investigation into the connections between deep learning and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group">renormalization group</a> of physics. The latter feels like a kind of microscope for theoretical physicists $-$ the renormalization group formalizes a sequence of scaling transformations acting on a physical system, typically zooming out and thereby coarse-graining the preceding image of the system. This parallels feeding the image of the system into a "deep" sequence of convolutional layers. Two references for this are a 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3124">paper</a> of Cédric Bény, and a 2014 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3831v1">paper</a> of Pankaj Mehta and David Schwab, and I imagine there is more recent work on this to explore. Dataset $\mathcal{D}$ is both an image dataset and a natural input to the renormalization group. It will give us an opportunity to better understand these connections, in particular we can start by repeating the experiments the latter paper runs on the Ising model.</li>

<li>A goal less directly related to ML is to augment the simulation to reproduce the simulations of Lubetzky and Sly on <em>information percolation</em> (<a href="https://math.nyu.edu/~eyal/papers/cutoffbhZd.pdf">main article</a> with visualization, and <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~eyal/papers/cutoffbh_expo.pdf">this</a> is a shorter expository version, still technical). Information percolation stacks each time-slice of the simulation described above (at some fixed temperature) into a 'space-time cylinder'. Multi-colored edges or 'bonds' are drawn <em>between</em> pixels in successive time-slices, based on how the simulation dynamics progress. The color of the bonds reflects different possibilities for how the update step is executed at a given pixel: sometimes, the randomness involved in the update is completely independent of everything else, and this is how the simulation gradually loses its memory of its starting point. The information percolation process outputs a graph or network inside the space-time cylinder encoding all aspects of the simulation. The relevance of information percolation is that becoming decoupled from the simulation starting point has the interpretation that the top slice of the space-time cylinder is <em>not</em> connected to the bottom slice through the information perecolation process. This is a way to graphically represent the 'mixing' undergone by the Ising dynamics. Lubetzky and Sly use this perspective to deduce lower bounds on how long the simulation dynamics must be run in order to sample effectively from the Gibbs measure of the Ising model. So this is a tool relevant to both bullet points above, and could look cool to simulate and visualize.</li>

<p>$\quad$ The Monte Carlo method is increasingly becoming part of the discipline it is meant to study. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical, <em>"almost experimental"</em>, approach to computing integrals using random positions, called <strong>samples</strong>. Below, we introduce some sampling techniques for continuous and discrete variables. We also discuss the basic principles of statistical data analysis: how to extract results from well-behaved simulations. We also discuss at length the simulations where something goes wrong.</p>

<p>$\quad$ In probabilistic terms, the integrals we desire to approximate correespond to the expected value of some observable, $\mathcal{O} : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$. Here we assume some implicit probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{S}$, the latter called the <strong>state space</strong>. Formally, the expected value $\mathbb{E} \mathcal{O}$ corresponds to the integral
$$
\mathbb{E} \mathcal{O} = \int_{ \mathcal{S} } \mathcal{O}(s) \,  \mu( \textrm{d} s )
$$
We write this expectation either as $\mathbb{E} \mathcal{O}$, or as $\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle$, the latter notation more common in physics.</p>

<p>$\quad$ We want to simulate most of the objects discussed throughout the notes, so we lose no generality in assuming that $\mathcal{S}$ is finite. $\mathcal{S}$ will be treated as a continuous object when it is more natural, or becomes convenient.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am tempted to jump to conclusions in the following way:first, note that if $\mathcal{S}$ is finite with $\# \mathcal{S} = M$, then $\mu$ corresponds to its probability mass function $p = (p_1, \dots, p_M)$. In this case, the above integral becomes the $\sum_{i=1}^M o_i p_i$ for a given vector $o = (o_1, \dots, o_M)$. The conclusion I jumped to was that approximating this sum happens first by estimating each $p_i$ through a statistic (like a histogram) $\hat{p}$ of some long-running simulation, and then taking a dot product of $\hat{p}$ with $o$. &gt; To be clear, in both direct sampling and Markov chain sampling, it seems instead that our approximation comes from taking measurements of a system as it evolves, and only after it has been allowed to evolve for some time. The measurements applied to each state of $\mathcal{S}$ are encoded in the measurement of the system, and the probability vector $p$ (of $\mu$) is encoded in the system evolution itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$\quad$ We wish to distinguish between two distinct sampling approaches:<strong>direct sampling</strong> and <strong>Markov chain sampling</strong>. We postpone the definition of a Markov chain until later; for now it is understood as a random walk.</p>

<p>$\quad$ Krauth explains direct sampling through a game played with small pebbles. The playing field is a large circle is inscribed into a large square, both drawn in the sand. In direct sampling, one has 'access' to the measure $\mu$ sampling from $\mathcal{S}$. In the context of the game, we will assume we can directly sample from $\mu$, which denotes the uniform measure on the square 
$$
\mathcal{S} \equiv \textsf{square} = [-1,1]^2   \,,
$$ 
a 'birds-eye' view of the playing field. Not only this, but we assume that we can also sample directly from $\mu$ multiple times, <em>independently</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The observable considered in the game is related to its goal, namely to compute an approximation of the number $\pi$. The observable $\mathcal{O} :\mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the indicator function of the unit disc, $\textsf{disc} = \{ s = (x,y) \in \textsf{square} : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \}$
$$
\mathcal{O} \equiv \mathbf{1}_{ \textsf{disc}} =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \quad s \in \textsf{disc} \\
0 &amp; \quad \textrm{otherwise}

<p>$\quad$ A player throws pebbles at the square, successively. Through the direct sampling, these land uniformly at random. The sampling is performed independently across draws from $\mu$. In particular, no pebble throw ever misses the square. Let $S_1, \dots, S_N$ denote the collection of locations sampled from $\textsf{square}$ in the above procedure: each $S_i$ is a random ordered pair $S_i = (x_i, y_i) \in \textsf{square}$, where all coordinates are mutually independent, $\textrm{Unif}([-1,1])$ random variables.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>$\quad$ To describe how the samples $S_i$ are used to approximate the value of $\pi$, we introduce the <strong>empirical measure</strong> $\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}$, a random probability measure on $\mathcal{S}$, defined to encode the locations $S_1, \dots, S_N$: 
$$
\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}} := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{S_i},
$$
where in general $\delta_S$ denotes the delta mass at the random point $S$.  Measures are in a sense dual to sets, and the <strong>delta mass</strong> $\delta_X$ is a measure acting on sets in the following way: given measurable $B \subset \textsf{square}$, we have
$$
\delta_S = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \quad \textrm{ if } S \in B, \\
0 &amp; \quad \textrm{ otherwise. }
\end{cases}

The empirical measure $\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}$, by definition, acts on sets $B \subset \mathcal{S}$ by reporting the fraction of the direct samples $S_i$ landing in $B$.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>$\quad$ There is a sense in which the measures $\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}$ 'converge' to $\mu$, and the game, or simulation, is designed to exploit this. Let us enumerate the states of $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, \dots, s_M \}$. In practice, the size of $M$ will be determined by the 'resolution' of the floating points used in sampling. In accordance with the observable $\mathcal{O}$, the set we choose for $B$ is $\textsf{disc}$. This is because
$$
\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}( \textsf{disc} ) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{S_i}( \textsf{disc} ) \equiv \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^M \mathcal{O}(S_i)
$$
The sense in which $\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}$ converges to $\mu$ implies, in particular, that the sequence of numbers $\mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}(\textsf{disc})$ converges to $\mu( \textsf{disc} )$ as $N \to \infty$. This convergence can also be seen as a consequence of a law of large numbers.</p>
<p>In the present context, the relevant subset of $\textsf{square}$ is the disc of radius one, centered at the origin. We refer to this as $\textsf{disc}$. The output of the first algorithm below is</p>
$$
4 \cdot \mu_N^{\textrm{direct}}(\textsf{disc}) \approx 4 \cdot \mu( \textsf{disc}) \equiv 4 \cdot \frac{ \pi}{4} 
$$<p>Thus we are approximating $\pi$ by approximating $\pi/4$, which is the probability that a pebble sampled from $\mu$ lands in $\textsf{disc}$.</p>

<p>Krauth remarks that none of the results of this table have fallen in the error bounds known since Archimedes. Another remark of Krauth: <em>"The people adopt a sensible rule: they decide on the total number of throws, before they start the game."</em> (This is as in the above python code.) <em>"They understood that one must not stop a stochastic calculation simply because the current result appears accurate, nor should they continue to play because the answer they get isn't close enough to their idealized target."</em></p>

<p>$\quad$ We now consider a new game being played on the same field, with different rules. We again take a birds-eye view of the playing field, so our state space is again $\mathcal{S} = \textsf{square}$. The game starts with a person at the corner of the helipad, corresponding to coordinates $(1,1)$ in $\mathcal{S}$. In Krauth's description, in each coordinate, the walker takes a step via adding independent, $\textrm{Unif}([-\delta, \delta])$ random variables. Thus it is possible for a next step which takes the person outside the square. If this is the case, instead of taking the step, the walker does nothing. This step still 'counts' in the aggregation we will perform. Krauth describes this procedure in terms of the pebbles: the person takes another pebble from their bag and places it on top of the one pebble (or perhaps pebble pile) marking their current location.</p>

<p>$\quad$ In the present setting, the <strong>samples</strong> $X_1, \dots, X_N$ are not independent, but rather have the structure of a Markov chain, specifically a random walk with independent increments. Let us use $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_N$ denote these independent increments. In Krauth's description, each of these is a $\textrm{Unif}([-\delta, \delta])$ random variable. For reasons that Krauth discusses later, and we will comment on this, we instead assume that each $\xi_j$ is a discrete random variable uniformly distributed on the two-element set $\{ -\delta, \delta \}$. We have distinguished the starting point of the sampling at $X_0 = (1,1)$. Following the above description, one then has
$$
X_1 = 
\begin{cases}
X_0 + \xi_1\,, &amp; \quad \textrm{ if } X_0 + \xi_1 \in \textsf{square}\\
X_0 &amp; \quad \textrm{ otherwise }
\end{cases}

$$
X_j = 
\begin{cases}
X_{j-1} + \xi_j\,, &amp; \quad \textrm{ if } X_{j-1} + \xi_j \in \textsf{square}\\

<p>$\quad$ One might be tempted to use random initial conditions, assigning independent $\textrm{Unif}([-1,1])$ random variables to the two coordinates. We avoid this because the Markov chain methods become most useful when no direct sampling method exists. It is for exactly this reason that we also avoid directly sampling from $\textrm{Unif}([-\delta, \delta])$ random variables: such objects are a linear transformation away from directly sampling from the $\textrm{Unif}([-1,1])$ distribution, perhaps at lower resolution.</p>
<p>$\quad$  Consequently, our Markov-chain sampling simulations start at the corner $(1,1)$ for concreteness. They can also be assumed to start from where a previous simulation left off. Following this convention throughout these notes, we usually focus on going from configuration $i$ to configuration $i+1$. This is the defining property of (discrete-time) Markov chains: the transition probabilities of the process depend only on the current position.</p>

<p>$\quad$ Let us discuss how to choose the  'throwing range' is $\delta$. It is akin to (largest possible) step size for the walker. Roughly, if $\delta$ is too small, the acceptance rate may be high, but the claim is that the walk will not be able to explore enough to well-approximate the integral. Choosing $\delta$ too large means the walk will have a hard time making successful moves, also hindering exploration. Krauth: <em>"The time-honored rule of thumb consists in choosing $\delta$ neither too large, nor too small, so that the acceptance rate turns our to be on the order of $\frac{1}{2}$."</em> I didn't observe results agreeing with their rule of thumb. I found much more success with $\delta = 0.05$ versus their recommendation of $0.3$. I did however observe the approximation worsen as the step size was taken larger past $\delta = 1$.</p>

Both approaches to the sampling evaluate an observable $\mathcal{O} : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$. In our examples, $\mathcal{S} = \textsf{square}$, and the observable $\mathcal{O}$ is the indicator function of the disc within the square:

\int_{-1}^1 \textrm{d} x \int_{-1}^1 \textrm{d}y \, \mu (x,y)

<p>My understanding of $\mu(x,y)$ is that it is used to denote the density of probability measure $\mu$, so it integrates to one. Within the above bounds of integration, it can be taken as a constant, namely $1/4$, which is the reciprocal of the area of $[-1,1]^2$.

<p>$\quad$ The multiple integral above is integration in two variables, so it doesn't feel like it is genuinely a 'high-dimensional' integral to compute. On the other hand, we are already know of a kind of Markov chain on a high-dimensional space, namely the Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on $\mathbb{T}$, the two-dimensional torus $( \mathbb{Z}\, /\, (n\cdot \mathbb{Z}) )^2$.  All in all, it seems that one is approximating an integral in an arbitrary number of dimensions (number of spins in the case of Ising model) through what is essentially a path integral. The path integral is a sum of observables of the system, as the system evolves.</p>

<p>$\quad$ Krauth: <em>"Direct sampling, the approach inspired by the game, is like pure gold: a subroutine provides an independent hit at the distribution function $\pi$. Notwithstanding thee randomness in the problem, direct sampling, in computation, plays a role similar to exact solutions in analyitcal work, and the two are closely related. In direct sampling, there is no throwing-range issue, no worrying about initial conditions, and there is a straightforward error analysis -- at least if $\mu$ and $\mathcal{O}$ are well behaved. Many successsful Monte Carlo algorithms contain exact sampling as a key ingredient."</em></p>
<p>$\quad$ <em>"Markov-chain sampling, on the other hand, forces us to be much more careful with all aspects of our calculation. The critical issue here is the correlation time, during which the position of the walker retains a memory of the starting configuration. This time can become astronomical. In the usual applications, onee is often satisfied with a handful of independent samples, obtained through week-long calculations, but it can require much throught and experience to ensure that even this modest goal is achieved. We shall continue our discussion of these methods in a later section. We first look briefly at the history of stochastic computing."</em></p>

when we assume the chain is stationary. This calculation yields the <strong>forward equation</strong> 
$$
m_{t+1} = m_t Q , \quad t \in \mathbb{N}
$$
using the convention that the pmf $m_t$ of $X_t$ is regarded as a row vector.  The forward equation is linear and explicitly solvable when the chain is stationary. We proceed inductively to find
$$
m_t = m_1 Q^t , \quad t \in \mathbb{N} \,,
$$
and one of the central questions in Markov chain theory is to understand the behavior of $m_t$ as $t\to\infty$. This question explains the importance of the eigenvalue spectrum of $Q$ to Markov chain theory: diagonalizing $Q$ is an efficient way to compute $Q^t$ for $t$ large, and the spectrum of $Q$ largely governs the long term behavior of the system.</p>

<p>$\quad$ The above definition is of central importance to our simulation goals. The reason is that, for Markov chains with a unique stationary distribution $m$, the measures $m_t \equiv \mathbb{P}(X_t = \cdot )$ converge to $m$, in an appropriate sense, as $t \to \infty$. When we simulate a Markov chain, we are sampling from $m_t$, and we want to run the simulation long enough (taking $t$ large enough) so that $m_t \approx m$. This is how a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation can be used to approximate sampling from $m$. In practice, instead of starting with some Markov chain dynamics, we will always start with a measure $m$ on $\mathcal{S}$, which we would like to sample from.</p>
<p>$\quad$ The MCMC method then requires <em>finding</em> a stationary, ergodic Markov chain $X$ with state space $\mathcal{S}$, whose stationary measure coincides with $m$. This is how $X$ is used to simulate sampling from $m$.</p>

<p>$\quad$ In Krauth's pebble games, there was some discussion of initial conditions of a Markov chain: in the second pebble game, the person playing always had to start at a prescribed corner of the square. These are <em>deterministic</em> initial conditions. In practice, we agreed to assume simulations will start deterministically, or from where a previous simulation left off. In theory, it is useful to have a mathematical object associated to the <strong>initial conditions</strong> of a Markov chain: a probability measure on $\mathcal{S}$, denoted $m_0$. When initial conditions are deterministic, and start at some distinguished state $s_* \in \mathcal{S}$, the probability measure $m_0$ corresponds to the $\delta$-mass $\delta_{s_*}$. When $m_0$ is general, it models starting from where some simulation left off, whose information we have no (or only partial) access to.</p>
<p>$\quad$ The first equation in the above definition can be understood as describing the evolution of a Markov chain $X$ whose initial conditions are the stationary distribution $m$ associated to $X$. In this case $m_t = m$ for all $t$ if $m_1 = m$. That is, while the values of $X_t$ change with time (it's a stochastic process) its probability mass function does not. Thus the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain captures the intuitive idea of a dynamic equilibrium .</p>

<p>$\quad$ Considering the task of computing $m$ given $Q$: observe that $m$ is a left eigenvector of $Q$ with eigenvalue $1$. Further, $1$ must always be an eigenvalue of $Q$ since it corresponds to the right eigenvector $(1, \dots, 1)^T$. Thus, if we know how to solve for eigenvectors, we can determine $m$. Menon: <em>"What is interesting in practice is the converse: for large transition matrices, say when $\# \mathcal{S}$ is $10^6 \times 10^6$, it is more efficient to use Markov chains to approximate $m$, than to use naive linear algebra This observation plays an important role in web crawlers and search engines."</em></p>

<p>$\quad$ Returning to the main question of the Ising simulation: knowing how long to run the MCMC simulation for, or knowing how quickly $m_t$ converges to $m$ is related to how fast the Markov chain <em>mixes</em>. We now explore two examples of Markov chains whose state space is the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_{52}$. Each group element can be thought of as a possible shuffling of a standard deck of playing cards. The group identity of $\mathfrak{S}_{52}$ corresponds to some distinguished initial ordering. For each of the two shuffling methods described, the main question can be rephrased as: <em>"how many shuffles does it take to obtain a truly random (uniform) distribution if one begins with a perfectly ordered deck of cards?"</em>  The following term will be used.</p>

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\textrm{true}} .

The subscript '$\textrm{true}$' indicates that we view $Y$ not as an approximation to language, but as a stream of 'correctly written' English text, generated in real-time. This idealization is vague, but the main point is to identify the written language $\mathcal{L}$, in this case English, with a concrete mathematical object. In this case, the object is the stationary, stochastic process $Y$. The law $\mathbb{P}_{\textrm{true}}$ of this process is the analogue of $\mu$ in two previous contexts: the uniform measure on $\mathcal{S} = \textsf{square}$, and the uniform measure on $\mathcal{S} = \mathfrak{S}_{52}$. In either previous case, the purpose of the Markov chains involved was to approximately sample from $\mu$. Below, we discuss a family of Markov chains for approximately sampling from $\mu = \mathbb{P}_{\textrm{true}}$.

The trigram model is defined as a Markov chain with state space $\mathcal{A}^2$, but following the above remark, can be interpreted as a stationary stochastic process taking values in $\mathcal{A}$, inducing a measure $\mathbb{P}_{(3)}$ on the path-space $\mathcal{A}^\infty$. In general, the $(n+1)$-gram model induces measure $\mathbb{P}_{(n+1)}$ on $\mathcal{A}^\infty$.

Menon: <em>"the entropy of a random variable describes its uncertainty.

For images in general, I think 'contours' become the analogue of brushstrokes. Perhaps an efficient way to use a space character <code>_</code> is as denoting the start of a new transparent canvas layer, sitting over the previously drawn layers (copying the functionality of applications like photoshop). My impression of $3$-dim spatial data (e.g. virtual environments for games) is that environment information is efficiently stored in surfaces, the higher-dimensional analogue (by one dimension) of contours.</p>

The signal is sampled from the measure $\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{L}}$ on $\mathcal{A}^\infty$ corresponding to abstract language $\mathcal{L}$ with alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. This measure corresponds to a stochastic process $(X_t)_{t \geq 1}$, which we suppose is stationary. Because of the 'optimal encoding' perspective, it is important to be able to quantify the relationship between the lengths of a signal and its encoding. In particular, we assume some upper bound $M$ on the signal length to begin with, modeling signals as elements of $\mathcal{A}^M$ for some $M \in \mathbb{N}$. When referring to $\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{L}}$ in this context, it is understood as the projection of this measure onto $\mathcal{A}^M$, corresponding to the 'truncated' process $(X_t)_{t = 1}^{M}$.

<p>$\quad$ As discussed, the goal is to efficiently compress signals $\underline{X}$ drawn from the measure $m$. The relevance of the above defininition to compression is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>we first prove that $\underline{X}$ is $\epsilon$-typical with high probability</p>
</li>
<li><p>we will see that the set of typical signals is nonetheless small: the number of all possible signals is $\# \mathcal{A}^M \equiv n^M$, and there are only approximately $2^{M\textsf{S}(m)}$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>these facts combine to form a compression strategy: when we see a typical message, we begin its binary encoding (towards defining the lossless compression function $f$) with <code>0</code>, and we use $M \textsf{S}(m)$ bits to compress it. If the message is atypical, we begin its binary encoding with a <code>1</code>, and are more sloppy with how many bits we use to store. The formal statement of the first point is as follows.</p>

<p>$\quad$ The point of building up to this last section is that it lays the theoretical groundwork for how the MCMC method can be used to sample from a Gibbs distribution, which is an abstraction of the simulations run in the motivating <a href="http://bit-player.org/2021/three-months-in-monte-carlo">blog post</a>. What's next is to describe the Hamiltonian for the Ising model, from which the Gibbs measures and dynamics are automatically defined.</p>
